# Integration with AzureAd Identity

  Welcome to the Part 3 of the [Dapr Series](https://github.com/SiddyHub/Dapr/tree/eshop_daprized).
  
  This sample demonstrates our Front End ASP.NET Core Web App calling a Event Catalog ASP.NET Core Web API that is secured using Azure AD.

  The [main](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprAzureAdIdentity) branch, is the code base from [Part 2](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprDataManagement/tree/daprDataManagement) of the [Dapr Series](https://github.com/SiddyHub/Dapr/tree/eshop_daprized),
and [daprAzureAdIdentity](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprAzureAdIdentity/tree/daprAzureAdIdentity) branch is the refactored code base that uses the Microsoft identity platform to sign in users.

So please switch to **[daprAzureAdIdentity](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprAzureAdIdentity/tree/daprAzureAdIdentity)** branch to follow along.

This version of the code uses **Dapr 1.7**
